  <h2> Things I Like</h2>
  <p>
    I love many simple yet beautiful things in life â€” like the playful and curious nature of <strong>cats</strong>, 
    the peace and inspiration I find in <strong>nature</strong>, and the wonder I feel while gazing at 
    the <strong>night sky</strong> filled with stars. These little joys inspire me to stay calm, creative, 
    and always curious about the world around me.
